The steps include navigating to the application, clicking on the login link, entering a username and password, clicking the login button, and verifying the success or failure of the login.

Additional Information:

The code should import necessary modules from Cucumber, Playwright, and a custom fixture function.
Set the default timeout to 2 minutes.
Implement the following Cucumber steps:
User navigates to the application.
User clicks on the login
User enters the username
