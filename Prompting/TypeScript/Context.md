As an experienced developer proficient in TypeScript, React, and Playwright, I am looking to generate code that is simple yet maintains high-quality standards while adhering to best development practices. 

1. Please provide an example of code that meets these requirements.
1. Ensure to include explanatory comments, follow naming conventions, and employ appropriate design patterns. 
1. If necessary, feel free to suggest performance improvements or any optimizations. The goal is to create clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
1. Don't start method names with given/when/then â€” for better method names
1. you ever must to provide a the next on PageObject
async navigateToSearch() {
        await this.base.goto(WebPage)
}
1. you ever must to include on PageObject
    private Elements = {

    }
1. Generate the code for the gherkin provided on next questions

Here you have a sample for The PageObject that need to be created

import { expect, Page } from "@playwright/test";
import PlaywrightWrapper from "../helper/wrapper/PlaywrightWrappers";

export default class basicSearchPage {

    private base: PlaywrightWrapper;

    constructor(private page: Page) {
        this.base = new PlaywrightWrapper(page);
    }

    private Elements = {
        isinCode: "input[name='ISIN_Code']",
        searchBtn: "a[type='submit']",
        results: "#midSearchResult"
    }

    async navigateToSearch() {
        await this.base.goto("https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/html/midEA.en.html")
    }

    async searchIsinCode(isinCode: string) {
        await this.page.type(this.Elements.isinCode, isinCode);
        this.page.click(this.Elements.searchBtn);
    }

    async validaSearch(result: string) {
        const toast = this.page.locator(this.Elements.results);
        await expect(toast).toBeVisible();
        await expect(toast).toHaveText("result");        
    }

    async invalidtSearch() {
        const toast = this.page.locator(this.Elements.results);
        await expect(toast).toBeVisible();
        await expect(toast).toHaveText("There are no EA records which meet your search criteria. Please refine your query.");        
    }
}

Here you have a sample for The PageSteps that need to be created

import { expect, Page } from "@playwright/test";
import PlaywrightWrapper from "../helper/wrapper/PlaywrightWrappers";

export default class basicSearchPage {

    private base: PlaywrightWrapper;

    constructor(private page: Page) {
        this.base = new PlaywrightWrapper(page);
    }

    private Elements = {
        isinCode: "input[name='ISIN_Code']",
        searchBtn: "a[type='submit']",
        results: "#midSearchResult"
    }

    async navigateToSearch() {
        await this.base.goto("https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/html/midEA.en.html")
    }

    async searchIsinCode(isinCode: string) {
        await this.page.type(this.Elements.isinCode, isinCode);
        this.page.click(this.Elements.searchBtn);
    }

    async validaSearch(result: string) {
        const toast = this.page.locator(this.Elements.results);
        await expect(toast).toBeVisible();
        await expect(toast).toHaveText("result");        
    }

    async invalidtSearch() {
        const toast = this.page.locator(this.Elements.results);
        await expect(toast).toBeVisible();
        await expect(toast).toHaveText("There are no EA records which meet your search criteria. Please refine your query.");        
    }
}

Don't generate any answers now, just let me know you understand it
