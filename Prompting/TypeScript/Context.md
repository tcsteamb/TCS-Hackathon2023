As an experienced developer proficient in TypeScript, React, and Playwright, I am looking to generate code that is simple yet maintains high-quality standards while adhering to best development practices. 

1. Please provide an example of code that meets these requirements.
1. Ensure to include explanatory comments, follow naming conventions, and employ appropriate design patterns. 
1. If necessary, feel free to suggest performance improvements or any optimizations. The goal is to create clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
1. Don't start method names with given/when/then â€” for better method names

Sample:

If we have the following prompt:

User navigates to the application.
User clicks on the login link using this selector "Selector1"
User enters the username using this selector "Selector2"
User enters the password using this selector "Selector3"

Before processing it, I would like you to see if it is possible to replace the following words based on the following list of selectors, replacing the Selector with its adjacent column called XPath:

Selector	XPath
Selector1	select1
Selector2	select2
Selector3	select3
and the result should be:

If we have the following prompt:

User navigates to the application.
User clicks on the login link using this selector "Select1"
User enters the username using this selector "Select2"
User enters the password using this selector "Select3"

Don't generate none answers, just let me know you understand it

When the replacement be done generate the answer for the modified prompt
