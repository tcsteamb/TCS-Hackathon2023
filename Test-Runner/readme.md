# Test Runner

## Introduction

### P for Playwright 

Playwright is an open-source browser automation tool developed by Microsoft. It allows developers to automate the interaction of web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit (used by Safari). Playwright provides a high-level API for automating actions in web pages, such as clicking elements, filling out forms, taking screenshots, and more.

### TS for TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, making it easier to catch errors before runtime. By combining these two tools, we can create more reliable and maintainable tests.

### G for Gerkhin

Gherkin is a business-readable, domain-specific language used in the context of behavior-driven development (BDD) for describing the behavior of software systems. It is designed to be easily understandable by non-technical stakeholders, such as business analysts, product owners, and domain experts, as well as developers and testers.

### TestRunner

A test runner based on TypeScript and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) is a tool or framework that orchestrates the execution of automated tests written in TypeScript using BDD principles. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, and BDD is an approach that encourages collaboration between technical and non-technical team members through the use of natural language specifications.

## Get Started

### Setup:
1. Node.js Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.
1. VS-Code
1. Clone or download the project
1. Extract and open in the VS-Code
1. `npm install` to install the dependencies
1. `npx playwright install` to install the browsers
1. `npm run test` to execute the tests
1. To run a particular test change  
```
  paths: [
            "src/test/features/featurename.feature"
         ] 
```
7. Use tags to run a specific or collection of specs

### Folder structure
1. `src\pages` -> All the page (UI screen)
1. `src\test\features` -> write your features here
2. `src\test\steps` -> Your step definitions goes here
1. `src\hooks\hooks.ts` -> Browser setup and teardown logic
1. `src\hooks\pageFixture.ts` -> Simple way to share the page objects to steps
1. `src\helper\env` -> Multiple environments are handled
1. `src\helper\types` -> To get environment code suggestions
1. `src\helper\report` -> To generate the report
1. `config/cucumber.js` -> One file to do all the magic
1. `package.json` -> Contains all the dependencies
1. `src\helper\auth` -> Storage state (Auth file)
1. `src\helper\util` -> Read test data from json & logger
